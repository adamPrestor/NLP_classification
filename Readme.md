# Book discussions message classification

Project contains the implementation of several models and feature extractors for message classification.

## Report

Report is available [here](report/NLP_Classification.pdf).

## Setup

Tested with Python 3.6 and 3.7

1. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the experiments

The script that was used to produce the results in the report, can be run using the command

```bash
python classification.py
```

The notebook `cross_validation.ipynb` contains the same script in notebook form and is a good starting point for playing around with the models.
